This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: incorrect handling of requirements files.  The original `Dockerfile` attempts to install Python packages using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, but either the `requirements.txt` file is missing, or the path specified is wrong. The solution demonstrates the correct way to include and manage dependencies within a Docker image. This bug is a common source of frustration for developers new to Docker, and addressing it emphasizes best practices for building reproducible and robust container images.
